# twitter-monitor
Request-based Java application leveraging threads, API integration, HTML scraping, and OCR techniques to monitor and notify users of limited merchandise released via Twitter

Specifically, this project monitored:
- Twitter Posts
- Retweets if enabled
- Quote posts with quoted tweet sent as en embed as well 

Some files have been not included or information redacted (mainly those involving client's webhooks/monitored profiles) to protect privacy of previous clients

(Source code was lost with a hardware failure and recovered from a decompiling the program jar file, comments unavailable/some formatting may look odd)
